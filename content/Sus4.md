Triad with a 4th in stead of a third above the bass note.
Sus stands for suspension, a term from "classical" music indicating that it is a dissonant note that resolves in many cases to the third of the chord. Occurs frequently in dominant chords:
V4-3. In jazz harmony there is no need for resolution of the 4.
The origin of the suspension lies in renaissance or modal counterpoint and follows the pattern of
p-s-r: preparation (consonant)-suspension (dissonant)-resolution (consonant).
There are also 2-3, 7-6 and 2-3 suspension patterns (see also partimento prototypes IJzerman).
