The minor blues scale (or simply the “blues scale”) is similar to the minor pentatonic scale, with the addition of a ♯4. From the root of the relative major, it may also be viewed as a major pentatonic scale, with a raised 2nd (♯2) added, resulting in the major blues scale. The added notes are called blue notes, which are used for tension when improvising. The minor blues scale fits well with 7, m7 and—possibly—m7♭5 chords, whereas the major blues scale fits with maj7 chords.
