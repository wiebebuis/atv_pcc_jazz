Notes that arrive stepwise at a chord tone.
They can be  diatonic (using notes of the scale of that moment) or chromatic.
In the last case the approach note arrives at the chord tone always with a half step.
In most cases [[chromatic approach notes]] are more dissonant than diatonic ones.
The phenomenon is related  to [[Figuration]] in "classical" music.
