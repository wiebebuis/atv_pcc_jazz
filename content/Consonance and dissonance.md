In comparison to classic romantic music these concepts are redefined, although there are relations with "colourful" harmonies of Debussy and (especially) Ravel.

The term consonance derives its meaning from two words: con (with) and sonare (sound). Literally: sounding together. Or in other words: being in harmony or harmonious. For sounding together we have another term: resonate. Dissonance points at the opposite of consonance.

The terms consonance and consonance have a **physical** or acoustic side and a (music)**psychological** side: what we experience as euphonious, hideous, acceptable or strange depends also on custom, habituation and agreements.

In the course of history opinions on consonance and dissonance vary.
In early art music (late medieval era and renaissance) dissonances have to be prepared and  resolved. After 1600 (with the upcoming of opera and dramatic(!) madrigals, dissonances can enter unprepared for a dramatic effect.

Another example is the choice for chords to end a piece with: in middle ages and early renaissance an octave or octave with pure fifth (1-5-8), in later renaissance until into the romantic era a consonant triad, in jazz a triad with additions, and so on.
