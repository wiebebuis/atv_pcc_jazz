Providing accompaniment for soloists (comping) is a primary function of the rhythm section.

Comping provides an improvised background involving both chordal and rhythmic components. This connection of rhythm and voicings may be referred to as rhythmic voicings. When comping, a musician must support, complement, and give energy to the soloist while providing rhythmic variety.
