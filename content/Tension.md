Related to [[Consonance and dissonance]].
Tensions add colour to a chord, they can be dissonant in degrees:
Acoustically major seconds and minor sevenths are less dissonant than minor seconds and major sevenths.
A tritone can add a specific colour to a chord: since it is the exact division of a pure octave
since it lessens then stability of a chord. Its degree of disssonance depends of course on voicing; dissonant intervals become less dissonant when positioned in other octaves and in a not too low register.
