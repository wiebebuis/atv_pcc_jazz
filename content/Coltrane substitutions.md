These are among the most complex substitutions in jazz harmony. Variously known as ‘Trane changes, Giant Steps changes, or’Trane substitutes, this technique incorporates a process of key centers moving through a cycle of major or minor thirds. John Coltrane was the innovator of this challenging technique of harmonization, and it appears in several of his famous compositions, including “Giant Steps” and “Countdown.”

There is a link with nineteenth century chromatic harmony as used in the music of Franz Schubert, Frédéric Chopin and Johannes Brahms.
