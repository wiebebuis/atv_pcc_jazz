In use in jazz and pop music. A capital (uppercase) indicates a major triad. Minor triads are indicated with - or m after the capital, sometimes with a small letter (lowercase).
Arabic numerals are used for added notes sharps/flats/natural signs for alterations.
In principle Arabic numerals indicate absolute intervals and not scale notes. So C7, D7 and G7 are all dominant seventh chords. The 7th is always a minor seventh added to a triad. 
In C major I7 is a Cmaj7, II7 a minor seventh chord and V7 a dominant seventh chord.
Also we use the phenomenon of the added note and the suspension. F6 indicates a major triad with an added major sixth (f-a-c-d). F4 or Fsus4 indicates the chord F-Bb-C. In the classical tradition that fourth would resolve downward to the third of the chord, but in jazz (and other post romantic music) that is no longer considered necessary. The suspension is not anymore considered to be a dissonant in the traditional meaning.
