The common-tone diminished seventh chord is a chromatic non-functional chord that serves to expand another chord. Because it generally appears as a collection of neighbor tones, the common-tone diminished seventh is often described as a “neighbor chord.” The outer voices are especially likely to move by step or common tone; leaps (if necessary) are usually relegated to an inner voice.
