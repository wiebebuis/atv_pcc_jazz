In the context of jazz music refering to the vertical arrangement of chord notes.
In "cassical harmony" we speak of the position of a chord position: open and close.
And sometimes the note in the top voicing is indicated: Cmaj7 in third position, the third is in the top voice.

Horizontal (movements; cf. Barry Harris) = [[Voice leading]]
