(Originally mostly in use with "classical" harmony and harmonic analysis of "classical" music.)
Uses roman numerals (I-VII) and additional signs in Arabic numerals and sharps/flats/natural signs.
A roman numeral indicates a connection to a specific *key* and inidicates a triad on that *degree* made up of scale notes. In principle chords are constructed with scale notes.
With roman numerals the concepts of *root* and *inversion* play an important role.
Arabic numerals indicate additions to the triad (for example 7 or 9), or the inversion of a chord (for example 6 and 64 for the inversions of a triad).
Contrary to chord symbol notation, 7 and 9 are linked to available notes in the key or tonality of that moment. 
So in C major IV7 is contains f-a-c-e, a major seventh chord. IV7 is the same as Fmaj7. Sometimes, to indicate "lines" in one of the parts/voices, arabic numerals with dashes are used: V4-3 indicates V with a resolving suspension, a fourth moving to a third above the bass line.
This way of indicating lines stems from basso continuo notation.
There has been developed a custom to try to inegrate chord colour in roman numeral notation: for example in major the degrees would be I ii iii IV V vi viio. Capitals for major triads, lowercase for minor triads and so on.
It doesn't add much if you know in what key you are...
It only adds complications to the coding system.
