In western music theory this word refers to three things:
1. the way in which in late medieval music the  proportion between longa end brevis can be shaped (this refers to metre and rhythm)
2. an interval (referring to pitch in late medieval music), Hucbald names 9 in his *De Harmonica*.
3. the way in which scale and melody types are shaped. For western music (theory) there can be discerned three stages: a. antiquity and era of gregorian chant b. renaissance polyphony c. music in major/minor-tonality.
