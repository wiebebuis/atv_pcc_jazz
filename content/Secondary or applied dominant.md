An altered chord that functions as a dominant related to another chord than the tonic (I).
Can be realized by adding additional leading tones to the scale. A chromatic element is then added to the key. Forms of V and VII represent the dominant function (containing the leading tone of the scale).
For example in C major we can add a C#, functioning as a leading tone for the note d, the chord  A then functions as a secondary dominant to Dm, the II.

All forms of V and VII can be used as secondary dominant chord structures.

Secondary dominant work best if they are aimed at a stable harmony (major or minor triad or extended major or minor triads).
