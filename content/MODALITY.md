An overarching term for music that uses for its pitch collections only diatonic patterns, more specifically the scales known as church modes. In western music these scales were used before the appearance of major-tonality and the connected functional harmony in the late 16th century.

The scale patterns of the church modes are often used in jazz improvisation in connection with harmonies. For example the harmony of II7 in major can be connected to the dorian scale pattern, V7 can be connected to the mixolydian scale pattern. Of course the tonality is that of C major. The scale patterns serve as a kind of "mental grid".

The term is also used for a specific type of [[harmony]] that is different from so called functional harmony. 

In jazz harmony there is also the concept of [[Modal interchange]].
