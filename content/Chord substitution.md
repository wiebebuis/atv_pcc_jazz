A procedure to increase harmonic interest of the music.
Sometimes the term [[Reharmonization]] is used.
Diatonic substitution refers to different chords being suitable to represent a harmonic function on the basis of common tones.
For example in C major, I7 can be substituded by VI7 and III7.
V7 and VII7 can be substituted by ech other.
Subsitution in modal contexts is a different story:
Modal harmony differs from functional harmony that it is aiming more for colourful chord changes than functional patterns with resolutions and other voice leading patterns connected with functional harmony (descending sevenths for example in a chain of dominants, where the 7th becomes 3rd, becomes 7th etc.).
In general we will find more stepwise movement in the fundamental bass progression in  stead of 4ths and 5ths.
