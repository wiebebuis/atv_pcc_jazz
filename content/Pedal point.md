A prolonged tone in the bass above which the harmonies change.

A sense of tension/relaxation arisis because the bass is not constat consonant with the  harmonie above it. Very often on the tonic or dominant note of the scale.
A pedal point can also be used in upper voices (recitation tone). In medieval music it was a custom to sound the root note of the mode/scale during the whole piece. Sometimes together with fifth and octave (1-5-8)
