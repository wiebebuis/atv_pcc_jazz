Within the context of tonality, a process used to arrive in a new key, with a new tonic.
Most of the time common elements of both keys are used to create a bridge between the two keys.
An example of this is the so called pivot chord: a chord present in both keys but at a different degree and sometimes of another harmonic function.

In the literature there is a distinction between chromatic and enharmonic modulation. 
Chromatic modulation makes use of the alteration of notes of one of both scales. Enharmonic modulation makes use of rewriting notes or complete chords of the scale . In the last case so called symmetricla chords (like the diminished 7th chord, and the augmented triad) play an important role.
