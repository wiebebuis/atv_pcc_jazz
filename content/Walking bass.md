(1) In jazz, a line played pizzicato on a double bass in regular crotchets in 4/4 meter, the notes usually moving stepwise or in intervallic patterns not necessarily restricted to the main pitches of the harmony. The style arose as the use of stride piano patterns declined, and its first master was Walter Page in the late 1920s and early 1930s; it has since become _lingua franca_ for jazz bass players, allowing them to contribute pulse, harmony, and countermelody simultaneously.

(2) In boogie-woogie piano style, a repeating left-hand pattern of broken octaves.
