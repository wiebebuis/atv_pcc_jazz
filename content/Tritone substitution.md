Used often in [[Reharmonization]]: 
Also referred to as flat five substitution (abbreviated â™­5 sub), this device is used extensively in reharmonization. In it, a dominant chord is replaced or followed with another one whose root is a tritone away, and shares the same tritone.
For example in C: G7 and Db7 share the same tritone f-b.
