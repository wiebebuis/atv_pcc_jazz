A secular music with roots in African American folk forms, which arose in the Southern United States and became internationally popular in the 20th century. It has formed an integral part of jazz, R&B, rock, and to a lesser extent country music. The content and definitions of blues have changed to fit shifts in musical fashions, technologies, performance styles, and audiences, but it has maintained its own identity and evolutionary history. With its deep roots and broad influence, blues is widely regarded as the foundation for nearly all later American popular forms. (omo).
