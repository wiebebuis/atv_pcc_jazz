A basso continuo (through bass or thoroughbass; Fr. _basse continue_; Ger. _Generalbass_) is an instrumental bass line which runs throughout a piece, over which the player improvises (‘realizes’) a chordal accompaniment. The bass may be figured, with accidentals and numerals (‘figures’) placed over or under it to indicate the harmonies required. The continuo instrument can be a keyboard instrument (harpsichord, organ) or a lute. (OMO)
